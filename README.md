# CSE310-ToDoList

This project was focused on enhancing my skills with JavaScript by building a web-based to-do list application. Through this project, I aimed to create a dynamic and interactive task management tool that allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed in real time. It demonstrates the versatility of JavaScript in handling user input, manipulating the DOM, and managing tasks, while also showcasing exception handling for added robustness.

The primary goal of this software is to provide a practical demonstration of JavaScript's core functionalities. By designing this to-do list, I was able to strengthen my grasp of JavaScript syntax, DOM manipulation, and event handling. I also explored exception handling by ensuring the application could gracefully manage unexpected user inputs, like empty tasks.

Tools Used:
Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as the code editor
Microsoft Edge for testing the web application
JavaScript for writing the application logic
HTML and CSS for structuring and styling the web interface

Useful Sites:
MDN Web Docs (JavaScript Reference)
W3Schools (JavaScript Basics)
Stack Overflow - For troubleshooting code issues and understanding best practices.

Future Work:
Implement a feature for editing tasks after they've been added.
Add local storage support to retain tasks between browser sessions.
Improve the user interface with enhanced styling and mobile responsiveness.
